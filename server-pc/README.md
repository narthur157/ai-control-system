This is the code to be run on a 'server' or any linux computer. 

Everything in this folder is contained in an eclipse project, which can be imported by importing server-pc as a LeJOS project in eclipse.

Note however, that this is a LeJOS project so you will need the LeJOS eclipse plugin:

The runnable files in this project are meant to be run exclusively by the `run` bash script in the `robotics-research` directory, and not in Eclipse.
